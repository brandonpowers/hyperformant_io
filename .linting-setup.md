# Code Quality Configuration

This project has been configured with ESLint, Prettier, and lint-staged for consistent code quality and formatting.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check for code issues
- `npm run lint:fix` - Run ESLint and automatically fix issues
- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run format:check` - Check if code is properly formatted
- `npm run check` - Run both linting and format checking
- `npm run fix` - Run both linting fixes and formatting

## Configuration Files

- `.eslintrc.js` - ESLint configuration with TypeScript support
- `.eslintignore` - Files and directories to ignore during linting
- `.prettierrc` - Prettier formatting configuration
- `.prettierignore` - Files and directories to ignore during formatting
- `.lintstagedrc.js` - Configuration for lint-staged (ready for git hooks)

## Manual Usage

Since this is not currently a git repository, you'll need to run the scripts manually:

### Before committing changes:

```bash
npm run fix
```

### To check code quality:

```bash
npm run check
```

## Git Setup (Optional)

If you want to initialize this as a git repository and enable automatic code quality checks:

1. Initialize git repository:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. Install Husky hooks:

   ```bash
   npx husky init
   ```

3. Create pre-commit hook:
   ```bash
   echo "npx lint-staged" > .husky/pre-commit
   chmod +x .husky/pre-commit
   ```

This will automatically run linting and formatting on staged files before each commit.

## ESLint Rules

The project uses strict TypeScript rules including:

- No unsafe any types
- Require await in async functions
- No floating promises
- Prefer const over let
- No console statements (warnings)

## Prettier Configuration

- Single quotes
- Semicolons
- 2-space indentation
- 100 character line width
- Trailing commas
- Arrow function parentheses
